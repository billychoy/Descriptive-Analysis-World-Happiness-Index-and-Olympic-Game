    "From the above correlations plots, we can conclude the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. SAT Score has strong positive correlation with the percentage of Advanced Regents Examinees at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "In New York State, Regents Examinations are statewide standardized examinations in core high school subjects required for a certain Regents Diploma to graduate. For higher achieving students, a Regents with Advanced designation, and an Honor designation, are also offered. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the positive correlations plot that both 'Advanced Regents - % of Cohort' and 'Advanced Regents - % of Grads' have a strong positive correlation with SAT Score. This means that the higher the percentage of students in a school who take Advanced Regents Exams, the higher the SAT Score Avg. for that school. This hardly comes as a surprise as students who take the Advanced Regents Exams are obviously higher achieving students and are in a much better position to score highly on the SAT test as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. SAT Score has moderate negative correlation with the percentage of Grad Non-Advanced Regents Examinees at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that as the percentage of Grad students taking Non-Advanced Regents Exams at a school increases, the SAT Score Avg. for that school tends to decrease. This is interesting as it is somewhat in contrast with point number 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. SAT Score has moderate positive correlation with the percentage of White Students at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the percentage of White students studying in a school, the higher the SAT Score for that school. This seems to have a strong racial connotation. However, on a closer look, we can see that the percentage of Asian students is also moderately correlated with SAT Score, albeit not as strongly as that for White students. And this may dispel the idea that a particular race tends to do better on SAT scores. This is further established by the fact that the percentages of Hispanic and Black students also have only a weak negative correlation with the Avg. SAT score.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. SAT Score has moderate positive correlation with the Number of SAT Test Takers at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the number of SAT test takers at a school, the higher the SAT Score Avg. for that school. This implies that as the number of SAT test takers at a school increases, each individual student tends to score relatively higher which in turn leads to a higher SAT Score Avg. for that school.\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. SAT Score has moderate positive correlation with Avg. Class Size at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "As the average class size at a school increases, SAT Score Avg. also tends to increase for that school. This seems a bit counter-intuitive on a first glance. This is because as the number of students in a class increases, each student is supposed to get less personalized attention and care from the teacher which should lead to lower SAT scores. However it may be that SAT score depends on the independent effort of each individual student and has little to do with class attention and guidance received from the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "__6. SAT Score has weak positive/negative correlation with the percentages of Female/Male students at a School__\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the correlations are weak, this may imply that females in general tend to perform better on the SAT exam as compared with males."
